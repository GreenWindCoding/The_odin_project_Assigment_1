    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, heat ghee or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and slit green chilies. Sauté for a minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken or mutton pieces and cook until they are browned on all sides.</li>
        <li>Stir in the yogurt, biryani masala powder, turmeric powder, red chili powder, and salt. Cook for a few minutes until the meat is well coated with the spices.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped coriander and mint leaves. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add 4 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover, and simmer until the meat is cooked through.</li>
        <li>In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained rice. Cook until the rice is 70% cooked. Drain the rice.</li>      
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat in the pot. Cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Serve hot, garnished with fried onions and boiled eggs if desired.</li>
