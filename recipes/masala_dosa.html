    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dosa Batter: Rinse the rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds separately. Soak them in water for at least 4-6 hours or overnight. Drain the water and grind them together to form a smooth batter, adding water as needed. The batter should be of pouring consistency. Add salt and mix well. Allow the batter to ferment in a warm place for 8-12 hours.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Potato Filling: Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Add chopped onions, green chilies, grated ginger, and curry leaves
            . Sauté until the onions turn golden brown. Add turmeric powder and salt. Mix well.</li>
        <li>Add the mashed potatoes to the pan and mix thoroughly with the onion mixture. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves if desired. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
        <li>Make the Dosas: Heat a non-stick skillet or tawa over medium heat. Lightly grease it with oil. Pour a ladleful of dosa batter onto the center of the skillet and spread it in a circular motion to form a thin crepe. Drizzle a little oil around the edges and cook until the dosa turns golden brown and crispy.</li>
        <li>Place a portion of the potato filling in the center of the dosa. Fold the dosa over the filling to form a semi-circle or roll it up.</li>
        <li>Serve the masala dosa hot with coconut chutney and sambar on the side.</li>
    </ol>
