    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>250g paneer, cut into cubes</li>
        <li>500g fresh spinach leaves, washed and chopped</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1-inch piece ginger, grated</li>
        <li>2 green chilies, slit</li>
        <li>1/2 cup fresh cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp cumin seeds</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp garam masala</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red chili powder</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
        <li>2 tbsp oil or ghee</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Blanch the spinach leaves in boiling water for 2-3 minutes. Drain and immediately transfer them to ice-cold water to retain their green color. Drain again and blend the spinach into a smooth puree using a blender. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat oil or ghee in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
        <li>Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic, grated ginger, and slit green chilies. Sauté for another minute until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and the oil starts to separate from the mixture.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Mix well and cook for a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the spinach puree to the pan and mix well with the masala. Cook for 5-7 minutes on medium heat, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Add the fresh cream and stir to combine. Cook for another 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the paneer cubes to the spinach gravy and gently mix to coat them with the sauce. Cook for another 5 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, garnished with a drizzle of fresh cream or a sprinkle of garam masala, along with roti or rice.</li>
